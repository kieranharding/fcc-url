  <h1>URL Shortener Service</h1>
  <p>This is a little service to provide shortened URLs. If the url provided has already been shortened, you'll 
    see get an existing shortened version. 
  </p>
  <h3>Usage</h3>
  <p>To create and view a new shortened url, visit:
    <div class="example">https://kah-fcc-url.herokuapp.com/new/yourwebaddresshere</div>
    Example
    <div class="example">https://kah-fcc-url.herokuapp.com/new/https://freecodecamp.com</div>
  </p>
  <p>To use the shortened url, just visit: 
    <div class="example">https://kah-fcc-url.herokuapp.com/shortenedurl</div>

    Example
    <div class="example">https://kah-fcc-url.herokuapp.com/1</div> will redirect I know not where.
  </p>
  <h3>Why?</h3>
  This is a backend project as part of <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/url-shortener-microservice">
  FreeCodeCamp</a>'s curriculum. Specifically, it is my practice project for integrating a database into a nodejs project.
  Obviously for it to be useful, I would need a much shorter domain.
