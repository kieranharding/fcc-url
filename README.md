 you'll get an existing shortened version.

will redirect to FreeCodeCamp.
Why?

This is a backend project as part of FreeCodeCamp's curriculum. 
Specifically, it is my practice project for integrating a database into a nodejs project. 
Obviously for it to be useful, I would need a much shorter domain.
